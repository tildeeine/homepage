# Retrospective

This file is intended to be used to document my own retrospectves at the end of
major milestones. Simply put, it should document what went well, and what could
be improved. It might also be beneficial to consider what I learned from the
last sprint, and document that here as well.

I will review the structure once I set up my milestones, and once again upon the
first retrospective.
