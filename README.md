# Personal Homepage

This is a personal homepage project created to practice web development and showcase both technical and personal projects. It serves as a portfolio to display the work I've done throughout my years at university, as well as other creative endeavors.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice web development using modern technologies.
- Create a personal homepage to share a bit about myself.
- Showcase both technical and personal projects that I'm proud of.
- Use GitHub more effectively and practice version control.
- Motivate myself to work on and polish projects by having a platform to display them.

This page is mostly for myself. I don't expect anyone to actually check out the page, but it's a fun and motivating way to keep track of my personal development and the projects I am proud of. It allows me to see my own growth and accomplishments over time. If anyone else happens to see it, that's a bonus!

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast and user-friendly web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tildeeine/tildeeine.github.io.git

``` 

Then, install the dependencies:
