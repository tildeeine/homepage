# Contributing
Since this is not a collaborative project, this contributing file will describe points I want to work on regarding workflow and structure. This will serve as a sort of "reminder" file for my development process. 

This is definitely over-organizing for my project size, but since the motivation for te project is to learn more about development workflow and github as well as just learning to set up a webpage, i want to put effort into looking for current industry best practices and learn to follow a few of them. 

## GitHub
- **'.gitignore':** Use '.gitignore' to exclude files/directories that shouldn't be committed.
- **README:** Keep an updated top-level README for project introduction, setup instructions, and other essential details.
- **Atomic commits:** Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- **PRs:** PRs should be concise and tied to a specific task or feature.
- **Templates:** Use templates for PRs and issues.

## Project workflow
- **Iterative development:** Start with a minimal viable product, and then add features and improvements in iterations.
