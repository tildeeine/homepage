                        <p>Hey there! I'm currently wrapping up my fifth and final year in Cybersecurity and Data Communications at NTNU. I'm all about diving deep into software development and cybersecurity, with a real knack for tackling problems from all angles. I've already spent some time at Visma developing software, and I'm lined up for a cool pentesting gig at Mnemonic this summer.</p>

                        <p>I'm 23 and originally hail from Norway, but I've also spent a year studying in Lisbon, Portugal at IST, which was an awesome twist in my usual routine. Besides hitting the books and coding, I teach a couple of courses at NTNU, helping other students get the hang of security and digital economics.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not geeking out over cybersecurity challenges or helping students out, you can find me out hiking or maybe even at a martial arts class. I love staying active and keeping my brain and body sharp. Also, I'm pretty keen on joining CTF competitions now and thenâ€”it's a fun way to test my skills in a team setting.</p>

                        <p>I'm looking forward to landing somewhere I can throw in my lot with a team that's as down-to-earth as they are dedicated. Let's make something great together!</p>
