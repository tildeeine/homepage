# Portfolio Website Plan

**Objective:** To create a personal portfolio website showcasing my experience,
skills, and interests, and learning how to use github projects and industry best
practices for development.

## End Goals:

- A clear showcase of experience, skills and projects.
- Easy means of contact.
- Responsive webpage.
- Learn more on project management and github workflow. See
  [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more on this.

## Features:

1. **Homepage:** Introduction, a brief about me, and navigation links.
2. **Portfolio:**

- Grid of projects with images.
- Clickable to reveal more information, technologies used, and a link to live
  versions and source code.

3. **Skills Page:** List or icons showcasing skills (e.g., JavaScript, React,
   Python).
4. **Contact Page:** Contact form linked to an email. Links to LinkedIn, GitHub,
   and other social platforms.
5. **Experience Page:** Page listing professional experience. Sort of like a CV
   page.
6. **About me:** Page with other relevant information about me. Again, similar
   to this section in CV.
7. **Feedback:** Add some way to gather insights on usability, design and
   content of portfolio.
8. **Stretch goals:**

- **Interactive features:** Incorporate interactive elements (theme switcher,
  animations, etc.)

## Design:

1. **Color Palette:** Soft colors, modern. Nature-inspired. Main colors:

2. **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts, with Minion Pro for headings and Proxima
   Nova for body text.
3. **Layout:** Grid-based layout for portfolio, single-column design for mobile,
   and multi-column for desktop.
